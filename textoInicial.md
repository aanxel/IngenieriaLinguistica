_Verbs_


The common ~~emu~~ _may (modal verb)_ not _be_ able _to soar_, but for such a big ~~bird~~ ~~it~~ sure _can (modal verb)_ _run_. This flightless ~~bird~~ _has_ small ~~wings~~ relative to the ~~size~~ of its ~~body~~. Its long, powerful ~~legs~~, though, _allow_ ~~it~~ _to run up_ to about 30 ~~miles~~ (50 ~~kilometers~~) per ~~hour~~. Each ~~emu~~ ~~foot~~ has three forward-facing ~~toes~~ that _allow_ ~~it~~ _to grip_ the ~~ground~~, _thrusting_ the ~~bird~~ forward. A powerful ~~kick~~ _is_ also handy for _keeping_ ~~predators~~ at ~~bay~~.

~~Emus~~ _are_ ~~members~~ of the ~~ratite~~ ~~family~~, ~~which~~ also _includes_ ~~ostriches~~, ~~cassowaries~~, and ~~rheas~~. ~~They~~ _are_ among the largest ~~birds~~ in the ~~world~~, and ~~they~~'_re_ _found_ primarily in ~~Australia~~, but also in ~~New Guinea~~, ~~Indonesia~~, ~~Solomon Islands~~, and the ~~Philippines~~. ~~Emus~~ _beat_ the ~~heat~~ in hot, arid ~~habitats~~: ~~Their~~ grayish-to-brownish ~~body~~ ~~feathers~~ _provide_ almost complete ~~protection~~ from solar ~~radiation~~. Though _equipped_ with this natural ~~sunscreen~~, ~~they~~ also _live_ in ~~grasslands~~, ~~savannas~~, and ~~forests~~, _preferring_ ~~areas~~ with _access_ to standing ~~water~~.

~~Emus~~ _range_ over large ~~areas~~, _foraging_ on ~~fruits~~, ~~seeds~~, ~~plant~~ ~~shoots~~, small ~~animals~~, ~~animal~~ ~~droppings~~, and ~~insects~~. ~~They~~ _mate_ and _nest_ over the Australian ~~winter~~, and ~~it~~’s not always a loving ~~affair~~ — ~~­­females~~ _have been_ known to _fight_ viciously over unpaired ~~males~~.

Mating ~~pairs~~ _stay_ together for up to five ~~months~~, after which ~~females~~ _lay_ large, emerald-green ~~eggs~~ in expansive ~~ground~~ ~~nests~~. The ~~males~~ _incubate_ the ~~eggs~~ for about seven ~~weeks~~ without _drinking_, _feeding_, _defecating_, or _leaving_ the ~~nest~~. The ~~females~~, meanwhile, _have_ often _moved on_, sometimes _mating_ with a different ~~male~~ in the same ~~season~~. ~~Chicks~~ _stay_ with ~~dad~~ for about four ~~months~~, until ~~they~~ _are_ able to _eat_ on their ~~own~~.

~~Predators~~ of the ~~emu~~ _include_ ~~dingoes~~ and ~~wedge~~-tailed ~~eagles~~. ~~Snakes~~ and other ~~nest~~-raiders _devour_ ~~emu~~ ~~eggs~~, but ~~they~~’_re_ not the only ~~ones~~. ~~Humans~~ _farm_ ~~emus~~ for their ~~meat~~ and ~~eggs~~, too. One ~~emu~~ ~~egg~~ can _make_ an ~~omelet~~ big enough to _feed_ four to six ~~adults~~.
